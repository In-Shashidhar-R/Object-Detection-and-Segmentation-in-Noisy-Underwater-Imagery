# Object-Detection-and-Segmentation-in-Noisy-Underwater-Imagery
This project enhances underwater object detection using noise reduction (Gaussian &amp; Median filtering), segmentation (K-Means, Mean Shift, SLIC), and deep learning (U-Net). Region-growing &amp; CCA refine boundaries. Metrics (IoU, Dice, Accuracy) assess performance. Deep learning shows potential but needs optimization
